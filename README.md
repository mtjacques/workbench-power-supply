Workbench Power Supply made from old ATX PC Power Supply

I made this power supply in summer 2021 when I was creating a Makerspace in my house and wanted a workbench power supply. This design allowed me to use an old ATX power supply to supply 3.3V, 5V, 9V, 12V, and GND for all of my prototypes.

Components:
- ATX Power Supply
- Binding Posts
- 2-220 Ohm Resistors
- 1 300 kOhm Resistor
- 10 W Load Resistor

- Dual USB Terminal
- Red and Green LEDs
